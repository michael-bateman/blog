Ugh, today was a super long day…  Firstly, rowing was absolutely dreadful, completing a 64 minute workout and a custom 14 minute warmup.  Secondly, in science, we covered so much content I am so confused, and can’t study for the test on Friday.  Hopefully things will clear up on Wednesday.  And uh, French, well you know, it’s French - i.e. a lot of fun.

Tomorrow, my class has our course selection information session in our math class that should be fun.  I already know what I’m going to take for next year.

I just found out that at Upper Canada College, Y1 and Y2 students don’t get to vote for Head Steward in the preliminary ballot.  I feel it’s unfair.  Look, we are in the senior division next year, and the decision of head stewards will affect us.

Oh well, enough with the rant’s… Hopefully I will get something better to post about next time...
