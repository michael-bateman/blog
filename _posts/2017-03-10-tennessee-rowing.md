This is my first blog post in a while, and it is coming from Tennessee.  Last night (Thursday), we set out on a long journey.  We left Toronto at 9pm and arrived in Tennessee at about 12:30pm.  I have major difficulties sleeping on busses, and could only sleep for 3 hours.

Next week, after a hard week of training, I can look forward to heading to Florida.
