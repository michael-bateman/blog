Wow, it’s been a week, or actually longer since the last time I wrote a blog post.  I am writing this post while waiting at school until 5pm for a Trombone lesson…  Seriously 5pm?  I thought I would take this spare time to write a blog post about, hmm… well, nothing really but I thought I would write about my March break.  For my March break, I will be travelling to the United States, for rowing in Tennessee and then I will be continuing south for some vacation in Florida.  Will have a nice, hot 2 weeks vacation which will be awesome!

Hopefully, my injury will get better before the Tennessee so I can actually row!  Anyway’s it should be a fun experience!  Last year I got super sick which was not fun.  Then I went to Florida and it was absolutely dreadful.  Hopefully I will be a little more careful and not get sick this year.
