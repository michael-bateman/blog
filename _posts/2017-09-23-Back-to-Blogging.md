Wow! It's been a very long time since I last wrote a blog post, so let me inform all of you what I have been doing.

During the summer I travelled to a couple of places such as Vancouver and my cottage, which is located in Quebec. I also was rowing this summer, which was very fun! I raced at Henley in the double and flyweight 4+. Sadly in the flyweight 4+, we did not beat our record from last year, which was finising 4th. In the double, we were a couple of seconds off from making it into the finals, but if we raced in another heat, we would have made it.

For the past couple of weeks, I have been debating whether to get the iPhone X. I'm still not sure because of the massive price tag, but the phone is amazing.

From now on, I am hoping to blog at least once a week, so make sure to add the RSS feed, by clicking suscribe!
