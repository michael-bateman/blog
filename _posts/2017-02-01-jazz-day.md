Today was a great day at school because it was jazz day.  Anyway, we did not have class and we just played out instruments for an hour.  Tonight we have out concert so hopefully all will be good.

Today, I have played over 5 hours of the trombone so far, so I am pretty tired.

I have the best week coming up.  Today I had off, tomorrow is a half day, on Friday it is a full day and then on next week Tuesday I do not have class on Tuesday due to the World Affairs Conference.  That will be awesome, since my last history class was on Monday, and my next one will be next week on Thursday!  Nice break of history and some other subjects like English.  Sadly, I will need to write my missed math test on Monday morning...
