Almost every morning, after going to the Upper Dining Hall run by Aramark at Upper Canada College, I usually find something dissatisfying about the food.  Well, today I wanted to tell you about the top things I dislike about the Upper Dining Hall breakfast service.  

Once, I found a hair in my food.  What would be your reaction?  Well, mine was horrible.  I was unable to eat at the Upper Dining hall for a whole day.  Today, my food was super greasy and some of the pieces of potato, were shredded into little bits.  Below, I have a photo from my own meal.

On the left, you can see that the food is very oily, and on the right, the food is in little bits.
