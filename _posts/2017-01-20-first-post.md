I thought I would make my first post interesting...

## 45th Presidential Inauguration

Today at my school (Upper Canada College) we watched stunned, as President Donald Trump was sworn into office today. This was a big landmark in history because after all, the United States is one of the most, if not the most powerful country in the world. Many of us thought prior to the election that it would be impossible for President Trump to win the election, but we were all wrong. A couple days and in fact going into the election, Hillary Clinton was winning according to Cable News Network (CNN). A lot of people, including myself thought that it would be a clear decisive victory for the Democrats and Hillary would be in office, however I was wrong.

The election in the United States was very important to me since I have cousins who live in the US. Also, with President Trump in office, he has said that he has plans to modify the North American Free Trade Agreement, or to totally remove it, which would be horrible for the Canadian economy.

Although I do not agree with all of President Trump's ideas, I do believe that he needs to be given a chance in the oval office to see what he can produce.
