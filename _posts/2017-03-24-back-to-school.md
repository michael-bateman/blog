Now since the break is almost over, I will be heading back to school.  I got to try many new things this break.  I tried parasailing and rowing port.  Also, an accomplishment I made was so far, Ive travelled on the whole entire interstate 75!  For the first stretch north of Detroit I was on 2 years ago for a hockey tournament.  From Detroit to Knoxville I was on the bus for rowing, and then from Knoxville to Tampa again, covering my whole route.  This brings my interstate travel to 2.  The Pennsylvania Turnpike, and the I-75 along with some smaller interstates.

Next week I am back off to school, but no more tie because it it now spring dress!

I have two tests for the first week back which is the literacy test and a music history test.
