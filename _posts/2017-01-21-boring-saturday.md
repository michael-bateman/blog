So I don't have much to do today, besides working on my website and yeah. I'm planning to make a new release for my website which will include a little new content and yeah.

Rowing was fun this morning, we did a technical workout, but yeah, it was fun I guess. In a couple of weeks we go to Tennessee! Yay!
